**Mikhail Grigoriev, Ruby on Rails developer (remote)**

Hi, my name is Mikhail. I'm a developer with broad experience in e-commerce and telecommunication projects, beginning in 2003. I also have worked as a UX designer and project manager, giving me a big-picture perception of software development.

I pay great attention to writing clean and maintainable code, automated testing, effective written communication, and deep understanding of a business domain.
